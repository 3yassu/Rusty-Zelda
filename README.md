## <=== Rusty Zelda: Zelda NES Implementation in Rust ===>

Your name is Felix. You spend your days laboring as a Rust dev and your nights hunched over your Thinkpad,
furiously modding various Discord servers. One night, a mysterious user sends you a link encouraging you to —gasp— code in
*unsafe Rust*. You open up NeoVim, crack your knuckles, and are at once transported to The Legend of Zelda (NES). Fight
familiar foes, locate the powerful Smart Sword, and defeat Corro the Unsafe Rusturchin to save the beautiful Princess Ferris and return to your
beloved NEET nest.
